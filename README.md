# Ideas :

## 1 - Chess AI. This project makes a game of traditional chess. We will implement a board GUI for the user the interact with to move pieces by clicking or dragging them. We will also program an AI that calculates and plays strong moves against the user. The AI would be able to play against itself or against a person with a board GUI.
2 - Graph-based Database. This project would create an interface for working with a graph database, similar to neo4j, with pared down features. The database would offer functions that abstract the implementation and maybe a CLI to work with the underlying data. It would be possible to add nodes and edges with customized  The database would allow for analysis such as clustering and connectednessAs a stretch goal we could create a very basic social media platform that would allow users to make friends and the system would recommend new friends based on the information and the database.
3 - AI Library. This project aims to build a library capable of constructing neural network based artificial intelligence for general purpose. The library will offer a high level of abstraction, operating all elements of a general neural network from a relatively simple client interface. At least two implementations will be present, one of a backpropagating AI (given a dataset of matched data items) and an evolutionary AI (given some heuristic function). Each interface should offer some customizability in the parameters of their function as to allow clients to optimize for their specific project, though default values should also be included. At least one rudimentary proof of functionality will be included.
